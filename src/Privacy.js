        <p><strong>4. MANAGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br />
            Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please use the Contact Us option on our Site, or call or write to us at the telephone numbers or appropriate address for changes listed on your account statements, records, online or other account materials.</p>
        <p><strong>5. OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong><br />
            In addition to information you provide directly to us, we may collect other information about you, including acquiring and using services provided by third parties who collect and analyze customer data.</p>
        <p><strong>Collect information in a variety of ways, including:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>THROUGH YOUR BROWSER OR DEVICE:</strong><br />
            Certain information is collected by internet browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, device identifier, language, and Internet browser type and version. We may also collect your IP address, along with the time of your visit and the page(s) visited.</p>
        <p><strong>THROUGH YOUR USE OF OUR MOBILE APPS:</strong><br />
            When you download and use one of our mobile apps, we may collect and/or track app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to or presented through the app.</p>
        <p><strong>USING COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS, DEVICE PROFILING, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES:</strong><br />
            We may use cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies to collect browser, device and other information, such as time spent on the Site, pages visited, and other traffic data. These cookies may contain or reflect segment or other interest-based data in a de-identified form including interests across other sites. We may also collect various attributes associated with your device (such as IP address, installed fonts, language and browser settings, and time zone) in order to create a device fingerprint or identifier so that we can recognize your device. Other similar tracking technologies may be introduced and used by us in the future in connection with the Site.</p>
        <p><strong>PHYSICAL LOCATION WHEN USING YOUR MOBILE DEVICE:</strong><br />
        </p><p>We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or wireless local area network signals, as well as through the use of beacons. We may also use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, but, if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content. We will collect your precise physical location only with your consent. You can de-enroll in these services at any time.
            You can choose whether to accept cookies through your browser settings. For example, most browsers allow you to automatically decline cookies or decline or accept a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site when browsing. If you decide not to accept cookies, some features of the Site may not work properly. In addition, the offers or content we provide when you visit our site or on third party sites may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
            Local Shared Objects, sometimes referred to as flash cookies may be stored on your hard drive using a media player or other software installed on your device. Local Shared Objects are similar to cookies in terms of their operation, but may not be managed in your browser in the same way. Restricting acceptance of Local Shared objects may impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with the Site. Similarly, certain authentication features of our mobile apps may set a persistent token, similar to a cookie, on your mobile device. This token allows that device to be uniquely associated or bound with your account. This token will remain on your device until you un-enroll from those features or delete the app from your device.</p>
        <p><strong>6. ONLINE ADVERTISING</strong><br />
            We may, directly or through third parties, serve ads regarding products and services intended to be of interest to YOU on the Site and on third party sites or apps. We and others may use the online technologies described in Section 5 above to make inferences and predictions about your characteristics, interests and preferences based on your online interests and activities across other sites. We may also use technologies to associate and recognize your various mobile and desktop devices in order to deliver ads and other content in a consistent manner across the devices YOU use. Information we collect using the technologies described above may also be associated or linked with personal information, such as email or postal address, you provided directly to us or others.
            Alternatively, personal information may also be linked with characteristics or attributes about YOU in support of our marketing efforts. We may use, or share with others (in anonymous or non-readable form where appropriate) your information in order to better recognize YOU when visiting the Site and to provide relevant advertising based on your interests, on the Site, on other sites and apps and other channels including television, email and direct mail. If you opt out of interest based advertising, as described below, you will not receive such customized ads on the Site or in other places.</p>
        <p>Both the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance provide information about and technologies to opt-out of receiving some or all interest based advertising. YOU can also opt-out of interest based advertising by clicking on the appropriate icon within an interest based ad which will take you to tools to help you manage these choices. These technologies are browser and device specific, they must be adopted on each device you use. If you block or clear cookies, these technologies may not work. YOU will continue to see ads on the Site which reflect how you use the Site and our services.</p>
        <p><strong>7. DO NOT TRACK</strong><br />
            Some browsers have a do not track feature that lets YOU tell web-sites that YOU do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser "do not track" signals.</p>
        <p><strong>8. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br />
            The security of personal information about YOU is a priority. We seek to protect this information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information within our organization. We provide employee training in the proper handling of personal information. When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of personal information they receive from us. Although we take extensive measures to protect your personal information, and to anticipate and mitigate new threats to personal information, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We do not guarantee that we have eliminated all risks associated with your sharing of Personal Information with  SILICON BEACH TESTING LABS LLC. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately contact us.</p>
